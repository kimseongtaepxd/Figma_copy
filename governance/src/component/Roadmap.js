        <p>
          WEMIX3.0 mainnet, developed on a decentralized architecture, will
          introduce a multi-phase democratized governance where the community is
          empowered to impact the 40 authority node governance structure through
          the introduction of a delegated staking module. This is the
          fundamental principle of the mainnet's roadmap, a means to illustrate
          true democratization through adoption of meritocracy based on
          contribution to the ecosystem.
